								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Verzenios Molecule Puzzle is an interactive application developed for the <em>POST-SABCS</em> event hosted by the <em>ABCSG</em> (Austrian breast &amp; colorectal cancer study group). The client Lilly wished to spark visitors&#8217; interest in Verzenios, their targeted medicine to treat a type of breast cancer. Which is why the application was designed for a transparent OLED touch display and was also deployed on iOS tablets. The application consists of a small puzzle game, in which the player has to put the medicines molecular structure back together, followed up by a small brand oriented quiz.</p>
<p>We wanted to keep the apps visuals close to Verzenios&#8217;s brand design, which is why we decided to go for 2D instead of 3D content. The simple and clean graphic sprites provide a modern and user-friendly interface. Visual feedback was a strong focus in design, which provides for an enjoyable experience. Button and sprite graphics are animated when idle, as well as when interacted with.</p>
<p>Because individual visitors would only spent a short time at the display, the app is quite short. The puzzle part had to be designed easily understandable, which is why we only relied on familiar touch controls with drag and drop mechanics. Usability was further strengthened by a short tutorial animation at the beginning.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aberration is a survival horror game. The player is on board of a deep space science vessel named &#8220;Discovery&#8221;. You and your small crew are part of the first interstellar hyperspace travel, which ends in a frightening odyssey nobody could have expected. Lost in the depth of space you have to navigate through tight corridors or maintenance ducts, solve puzzles to unlock new areas and explore the damaged ship to uncover the truth about the fate of the Discovery and her crew.</p>
<p>The game features an explorable interactive environment with 5 main areas and several secondary ones, an inventory system with simple crafting and an enemy AI. Most of the geometry was rendered using dynamic lighting, with ambient lights and fine color tints added into baked light maps.</p>
<p>Aberration started as part of the education at the <a href="http://www.sae.edu/aut/de">SAE Institute</a> in Vienna and was later on continued as a free project, in collaboration with <a href="http://25games.net/">25games</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Energy Capture VR is a Cardboard game featuring three levels based around the renewable energy sources: wind, solar and hydroelectricity. Our client, <a href="https://en.mishkat.org.sa/our-story/">Mishkat Interactive Center</a>, focuses on inspiring and teaching younger generations in Saudi Arabia about atomic and renewable energy. The goal of the game was to teach the basic concept of renewable power production methods in a playful and engaging way to younger people.</p>
<p>The game supports most modern smart phone devices and 2 languages (english and arabic), and features 3 levels with unique game design, a scoreboard and soundtrack. It can be played by using any Google Cardboard glasses, or without any additional hardware with the gyroscopic sensor of your phone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vri.mishkat&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/energy-capture/id1051688656?mt=8">iTunes store</a> for free!</p>
<p>We collaborated with <a href="http://visual-ex.com/">Visual Experience</a>, a VR company based in Saudi Arabia, to handle communication, translation, initial concept and quality assurance.</p>
