								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hofer VR configurator is a VR tour app on the GearVR, produced for the Austrian supermarket chain Hofer. The app has been designed for employees to digitally navigate through a Hofer store, while also being able to change interior details like floor tiles, wall colors or the shelves for fruit and vegetables. To achieve this, 360° panoramic photographs have been shot in the store at 7 different locations. To create a better feeling of depth, the photographs were shot stereoscopic, which means two pictures with a slight offset had to be taken for each way-point in the app. Those images have then been applied as textures onto two spheres per location, one for each eye.</p>
<p>After that, the virtual shop layout, scaling and camera positions needed to be established, in order to position and render the store additions as separate 360° stereoscopic images. Furthermore, masks needed to be painted manually so that only the right parts are put over the photographs. At the end the final images were then blended in and out on top of the photographs to create the configurator. The user can control store configurations via a menu, which can be navigated either by gaze control, or by using the GearVR touch pad on the side of the headset. Navigation through the store works by looking at way-point icons which moves the user through the environment while blending from one set of spheres to the next. Alternatively, the menu map can be used to jump to any way-point instantaneously.</p>
<p>Features of the app include 7 way-points located around the shop, three different floor types, two wall and header board colors, one alternate fruit &amp; vegetable stand as well as one freezer row. The two latter ones had options to display them either full of products or empty. The menu contains four sections: plan, colors, furniture and presets. Presets allow the user to change the entire store at once with predefined configurations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feel your future home 360° is a service that lets you discover your future home or any other interior project ranging from hotels to shopping malls, even when still under construction. Usually the application consists of a main menu and at least one VR scene, where users can navigate through any space via gaze input control. The service is very versatile. Single projects may contain any number of scenes, use 360° photography or rendering in either monoscopic or stereo variation (both cube and spherical) and can even offer layers added ontop, to offer users the ability to change elements in the scene, like the floor of a room. Menu scenes and other interface elements can be simple but effective, or custom tailored and ambitious to create a more engaging experience.</p>
<p>Currently only deployed on Samsung GearVR, expansion on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, WebGL and Google Cardboard are also possible if required.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BeThere Makkah is a Google Cardboard VR app which lets you see several places of interest in the city of Mecca, located in Saudi Arabia. The app comes together with a custom Booklet, which transforms into Cardboard Glasses when folded open. We created a menu and a new navigation interface for the allready existing 360° photographs and handled building, testing and publishing the app. BeThere Makkah features four different locations, each with several photographs and an audio narration on the history of the most important places of interest.</p>
<p>BeThere Makkah is currently available in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vex.btmakkah">Google Play</a> and iOS for free.</p>
