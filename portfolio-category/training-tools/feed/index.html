								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Avesor Explorer is an innovative and interactive software analytics tool. It is designed to provide easy and structured visualizations of otherwise unclear and confusing legacy software systems like Cobol, RPG or PL/1. Utilizing immersive VR technology, users get to see a complete overview of their software system, with many features to identify possible problem areas and dependencies. The software systems source code will be analyzed automatically, which then provides the necessary information for the Avesor Explorer application. The source code itself does not need to be copied or transferred and can be analyzed on site.</p>
<p>We chose to design the application for the Virtual Reality device Oculus Go because of its wide field of view and 360° 3D visualization capabilities. In VR, users are able to see large amounts of information simultaneously, with very little overlapping elements. This maximizes efficiency and saves time compared to a regular display on a tablet or desktop PC. Additionally, the controller allows for intuitive and quick navigation and operation inside Avesor Explorer.</p>
<p>Information about complexity, size, domain and many more are visible at a glance, by utilizing shapes, colors, animation and effects. Additionally, a detailed table provides a more complete look on the system and comes with sorting algorithms for every category. We have also included advanced filter mechanics, which allow users to find and analyze very specific elements about the system. The application also features remote update functionality and is currently available in two languages (German and English).</p>
<p>Customization options are available on request, which include changes to interface colors, company logos or other features of the application.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a prototype of a virtual reality rehabilitation software sponsored by Fakeeh hospital in Saudi Arabia. The goal of the project was to test the success of VR systems for the rehabilitation of stroke patients struggling with everyday tasks. The production of the finished project is expected to start soon.</p>
<p>The application was developed for the HTC Vive, since it is currently the best platform for room scale VR experiences.</p>
<p>Patients perform simple tasks in a virtual home: cutting carrots with a kitchen knife, using a fork and pouring water from a pitcher into a glass. All of these these actions should appear to be more successful to the patient to stimulate positive feedback, which helps the relearning process, while the actual performance can be monitored by the staff on the operator monitor. We also implemented features that allowed right and left handed users to complete tasks, depending on which controller they use.</p>
<p>The graphic style was chosen specifically to contain gentle colors while still being colorful along with soft shading. This gives the environment a more pleasant feel while still being thoroughly readable.</p>
<p>In the future we are planning to add several more activities, polish of existing activities and environment, further development of the operator user interface, with the integration of a patient database to monitor his performance and improvement.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We developed a small prototype designed for demonstrating the use of virtual reality for training exercises. The prototype was developed for the GearVR and HTC Vive. The application also supports the GearVR Controller.</p>
<p>The main features of the application include the visualization of four different burner flames, as well as a burner failure scenario. In the flame demonstration scene, the user can cycle through each flame. Performance of the burner at each state is further visualized by the glow intensity of the radiant tubes. The scenario simulates castable refractory failure on the ceiling, which happens after both burners are turned on. The resulting cracks cause dust to fall down, which in turn compromises one of the burners. The user has to compensate by increasing output of the other burner, which restores firing duty and ends the simulation.</p>
