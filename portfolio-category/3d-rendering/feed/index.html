								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://vr-interactive.at/portfolio-item/aristoteles-key-visual-webgl/">ARISTOTELES</a>, <a href="https://vr-interactive.at/portfolio-item/zulu-key-visual/">ZULU</a> and <a href="https://vr-interactive.at/portfolio-item/iris-key-visual/">IRIS</a>, ARISTOTELES SKY is the fourth of Kaiserwetters products to receive a new key visual graphic and interactive WebGL application. Aristoteles Sky is a real-time production data enriched energy cloud platform for nations. It is designed to mitigate energy transition risks and to improve accuracy for planning of new capacities like renewable energy generation, storage or grid expansion.</p>
<p>As with the other key visual designs, Aristoteles Sky also needed to be visualized in the same diorama art style. The main challenge for this project in particular was the correct presentation of scale on a heavily stylized visualization. The floating island should be recognized as a large country or continent instead of featuring a small area like in the Iris and Zulu projects. We achieved that large-scale feeling by a number of processes. Aside from a higher-fidelity mesh, the entire environment is slightly rounded to represent the earths curvature. The cameras field of view has also been increased and a slight fog effect has been applied to simulate atmospheric refraction. Details like the two cities and towns play into the illustrations diorama style and also represent the huge scale of the environment more directly.</p>
<p>As usual, we had to keep performance and data size in mind for the WebGL portion of this project. Parts of the 3D model which are not visible in the app have been deleted in order to reduce file size. Additionally, some geometry was duplicated and placed by script rather than imported as a whole mesh. Shadows, ambient lighting and ambient occlusion have all been baked into a texture and applied onto the models tightly wrapped UV layout. For the latter, finding the right balance between quality and file size is especially important.</p>
<p>The WebGL app features control variables to change position, size and animation speed to allow quick and easy customization for web deployment. We also implemented a new style of particle effect and made use of our mouse and tilt interactivity feature. The entire WebGL project requires just 1300KB and works on all WebGL supported devices.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another new service by Kaiserwetter, the <em>smart data analytics machine IRIS</em>, launched this June. Just like its other brands <a href="https://vr-interactive.at/portfolio-item/aristoteles-key-visual-webgl/">Aristoteles</a> and <a href="https://vr-interactive.at/portfolio-item/zulu-key-visual/">ZULU</a>, IRIS also got a new key visual graphic, along with an interactive WebGL version. This time, Apollo7 provided us with the initial concept. After adding our own ideas to the design, our job was to translate that design into a 3d scene for rendering and web.</p>
<p>Most of the time, memory optimization is the most difficult part when it comes to developing WebGL applications, as the entire scene and the components needed to run it must be downloaded by the user when visiting the page. The application needed to be small enough for fast downloading, while also staying close to the rendered versions visual quality. This was especially challenging for IRIS, as the scene was on a larger scale and had a lot of objects in the scene. Substantial memory savings were achieved by heavy optimization of the 3d files, carefully cutting away parts of the model that are never seen and optimizing the file export. A properly laid out UV map allowed for high fidelity shadows and ambient occlusion baked from the render software, while only using a single 91KB texture. Additionally, every unique prop has been imported and constructed only once and was then duplicated, positioned and randomized many times in the program.</p>
<p>Apart from its optimization, the IRIS WebGL application features animated objects, including a futuristic camera drone, which symbolizes the brand name. Particle wave animations and interactive mouse or device tilt controls are also included. For easy customization of web integration, several controllable variables allow for dynamic changing of animation speed, zoom and position. The entire application takes up less than 1000KB and works on all WebGL supported devices.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new online service configurator named ZULU was launched by Kaiserwetter, and just like its other brand <a href="https://vr-interactive.at/portfolio-item/aristoteles-key-visual-webgl/">Aristoteles</a>, ZULU also needed a new key visual graphic, along with an interactive web-GL version. Several different concepts have been developed in collaboration with Apollo7 in the initial design phase. After a fitting design has been found and agreed upon, our job was to bring that design into a 3d scene suitable for both rendering and web.</p>
<p>The 3d rendered scene was only needed to generate one static image in high resolution. This step was purposely done before the web version, to serve as a visual guideline for the web version and to finalize the key visuals look and feel more easily. Since animations and optimizations were not needed for the rendered version, adapting and changing the scene could be done very quickly.</p>
<p>The main challenge when developing for web-GL is always memory optimization, as the entire scene and the components needed to run it must be downloaded by the user when visiting the page. The application needed to be small enough for fast downloading, while also staying close to the rendered versions visual quality. A lot of our memory savings were achieved by optimizations of the 3d files, i.e. cutting away parts of the model that are never seen and optimizing the file export. A carefully laid out UV map allowed for high fidelity shadows and ambient occlusion baked from the render software, within a single 116KB texture.</p>
<p>Apart from optimization, the ZULU app features animated objects and character, particle wave animations and interactive mouse or device tilt controls. It also includes several controllable variables to allow easy customization for web integration. The entire application takes up less than 900KB and works on all web-GL supported devices.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This showcase project is designed to demonstrate a variety of products in different configurations, both as traditionally rendered 3D images and real-time rendered product visualizations. We developed a media and platform independent workflow which allows us to create several output variants simultaneously. 3D renderings allow for much higher resolution and detail, as well as more advanced and realistic effects such as refraction, dispersion or sub-surface-scattering. Real-time applications, while visually inferior, provide the user with the possibility to view the product in any angle and distance, change color and configurations of the product or play 3D or graphic animations in real time.</p>
<p>This project serves as a showcase to present our skills and experience in product visualization. We may continue to add new and different products, as well as new features to this product.</p>
<p>A video of the realtime version can be seen <a href="https://vimeo.com/232661683">here</a>.</p>
<p>Currently included products: compact camera</p>
<p>Currently supported features: orbiting and zooming the camera, interactive menu to change color and display different animations</p>
<p>Currently supported platforms: PC, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, WebGL</p>
<p>Static images were rendered in V-Ray, the application was built in Unity 3D.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feel your future home 360° is a service that lets you discover your future home or any other interior project ranging from hotels to shopping malls, even when still under construction. Usually the application consists of a main menu and at least one VR scene, where users can navigate through any space via gaze input control. The service is very versatile. Single projects may contain any number of scenes, use 360° photography or rendering in either monoscopic or stereo variation (both cube and spherical) and can even offer layers added ontop, to offer users the ability to change elements in the scene, like the floor of a room. Menu scenes and other interface elements can be simple but effective, or custom tailored and ambitious to create a more engaging experience.</p>
<p>Currently only deployed on Samsung GearVR, expansion on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, WebGL and Google Cardboard are also possible if required.</p>
