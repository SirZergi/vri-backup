								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Avesor Explorer is an innovative and interactive software analytics tool. It is designed to provide easy and structured visualizations of otherwise unclear and confusing legacy software systems like Cobol, RPG or PL/1. Utilizing immersive VR technology, users get to see a complete overview of their software system, with many features to identify possible problem areas and dependencies. The software systems source code will be analyzed automatically, which then provides the necessary information for the Avesor Explorer application. The source code itself does not need to be copied or transferred and can be analyzed on site.</p>
<p>We chose to design the application for the Virtual Reality device Oculus Go because of its wide field of view and 360° 3D visualization capabilities. In VR, users are able to see large amounts of information simultaneously, with very little overlapping elements. This maximizes efficiency and saves time compared to a regular display on a tablet or desktop PC. Additionally, the controller allows for intuitive and quick navigation and operation inside Avesor Explorer.</p>
<p>Information about complexity, size, domain and many more are visible at a glance, by utilizing shapes, colors, animation and effects. Additionally, a detailed table provides a more complete look on the system and comes with sorting algorithms for every category. We have also included advanced filter mechanics, which allow users to find and analyze very specific elements about the system. The application also features remote update functionality and is currently available in two languages (German and English).</p>
<p>Customization options are available on request, which include changes to interface colors, company logos or other features of the application.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a prototype of a virtual reality rehabilitation software sponsored by Fakeeh hospital in Saudi Arabia. The goal of the project was to test the success of VR systems for the rehabilitation of stroke patients struggling with everyday tasks. The production of the finished project is expected to start soon.</p>
<p>The application was developed for the HTC Vive, since it is currently the best platform for room scale VR experiences.</p>
<p>Patients perform simple tasks in a virtual home: cutting carrots with a kitchen knife, using a fork and pouring water from a pitcher into a glass. All of these these actions should appear to be more successful to the patient to stimulate positive feedback, which helps the relearning process, while the actual performance can be monitored by the staff on the operator monitor. We also implemented features that allowed right and left handed users to complete tasks, depending on which controller they use.</p>
<p>The graphic style was chosen specifically to contain gentle colors while still being colorful along with soft shading. This gives the environment a more pleasant feel while still being thoroughly readable.</p>
<p>In the future we are planning to add several more activities, polish of existing activities and environment, further development of the operator user interface, with the integration of a patient database to monitor his performance and improvement.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We developed a small prototype designed for demonstrating the use of virtual reality for training exercises. The prototype was developed for the GearVR and HTC Vive. The application also supports the GearVR Controller.</p>
<p>The main features of the application include the visualization of four different burner flames, as well as a burner failure scenario. In the flame demonstration scene, the user can cycle through each flame. Performance of the burner at each state is further visualized by the glow intensity of the radiant tubes. The scenario simulates castable refractory failure on the ceiling, which happens after both burners are turned on. The resulting cracks cause dust to fall down, which in turn compromises one of the burners. The user has to compensate by increasing output of the other burner, which restores firing duty and ends the simulation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hofer VR configurator is a VR tour app on the GearVR, produced for the Austrian supermarket chain Hofer. The app has been designed for employees to digitally navigate through a Hofer store, while also being able to change interior details like floor tiles, wall colors or the shelves for fruit and vegetables. To achieve this, 360° panoramic photographs have been shot in the store at 7 different locations. To create a better feeling of depth, the photographs were shot stereoscopic, which means two pictures with a slight offset had to be taken for each way-point in the app. Those images have then been applied as textures onto two spheres per location, one for each eye.</p>
<p>After that, the virtual shop layout, scaling and camera positions needed to be established, in order to position and render the store additions as separate 360° stereoscopic images. Furthermore, masks needed to be painted manually so that only the right parts are put over the photographs. At the end the final images were then blended in and out on top of the photographs to create the configurator. The user can control store configurations via a menu, which can be navigated either by gaze control, or by using the GearVR touch pad on the side of the headset. Navigation through the store works by looking at way-point icons which moves the user through the environment while blending from one set of spheres to the next. Alternatively, the menu map can be used to jump to any way-point instantaneously.</p>
<p>Features of the app include 7 way-points located around the shop, three different floor types, two wall and header board colors, one alternate fruit &amp; vegetable stand as well as one freezer row. The two latter ones had options to display them either full of products or empty. The menu contains four sections: plan, colors, furniture and presets. Presets allow the user to change the entire store at once with predefined configurations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feel your future home 360° is a service that lets you discover your future home or any other interior project ranging from hotels to shopping malls, even when still under construction. Usually the application consists of a main menu and at least one VR scene, where users can navigate through any space via gaze input control. The service is very versatile. Single projects may contain any number of scenes, use 360° photography or rendering in either monoscopic or stereo variation (both cube and spherical) and can even offer layers added ontop, to offer users the ability to change elements in the scene, like the floor of a room. Menu scenes and other interface elements can be simple but effective, or custom tailored and ambitious to create a more engaging experience.</p>
<p>Currently only deployed on Samsung GearVR, expansion on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, WebGL and Google Cardboard are also possible if required.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BeThere Makkah is a Google Cardboard VR app which lets you see several places of interest in the city of Mecca, located in Saudi Arabia. The app comes together with a custom Booklet, which transforms into Cardboard Glasses when folded open. We created a menu and a new navigation interface for the allready existing 360° photographs and handled building, testing and publishing the app. BeThere Makkah features four different locations, each with several photographs and an audio narration on the history of the most important places of interest.</p>
<p>BeThere Makkah is currently available in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vex.btmakkah">Google Play</a> and iOS for free.</p>
